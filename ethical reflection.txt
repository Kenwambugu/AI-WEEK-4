Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)
Prompt: Your predictive model from Task 3 (predicting issue priority) is deployed in a company. Discuss: Potential biases in the dataset (e.g., underrepresented teams) and how fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases.
Potential Biases in the Dataset (Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset adapted for Issue Priority)
Even when using a medical dataset like the Breast Cancer dataset (adapted here for "issue priority"), biases can arise or be introduced, especially if the original data collection was not perfectly balanced or if our artificial mapping creates imbalances. If this were a real "issue priority" dataset, common biases could include:
1. Underrepresentation Bias (for "Underrepresented Teams"):
   * Description: If the historical issue data primarily comes from certain dominant teams, types of projects, or geographical regions, while data from smaller, newer, or specialized teams (e.g., security, mobile development, specific backend services) is scarce.
   * Impact: The model might learn issue patterns primarily relevant to the well-represented teams. When applied to an underrepresented team, its predictions could be inaccurate or consistently misclassify issue priorities for that team, leading to their issues being overlooked or mismanaged. For example, issues from a specific, understaffed team might always be flagged as "low priority" because historically they lack the resources to report them effectively, or the model doesn't recognize their unique bug signatures.
2. Historical Bias / Labeling Bias:
   * Description: The "issue priority" labels (High/Medium/Low) in the historical dataset might reflect past human biases, rather than objective severity. For instance, issues reported by high-profile clients or influential teams might have been historically given higher priority, regardless of their actual technical impact, while critical issues from less influential sources were consistently down-prioritized.
   * Impact: The AI model will learn and perpetuate these historical biases. It might assign lower priorities to issues from certain teams, technologies, or user segments, even if the underlying technical severity is high. This can lead to critical bugs being missed, unequal resource allocation, and a perceived unfairness in the issue management system.
3. Feature Selection Bias:
   * Description: If certain features used in the model (e.g., "number of comments on issue," "reporter's seniority") are themselves correlated with historical biases in issue reporting or prioritization, they can indirectly introduce bias.
   * Impact: The model might inadvertently use these biased features to make predictions, leading to unfair outcomes.
How Fairness Tools like IBM AI Fairness 360 could address these biases:
IBM AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) is an open-source toolkit designed to help detect and mitigate bias in machine learning models. It provides a comprehensive set of metrics and algorithms for different stages of the AI lifecycle.
1. Bias Detection (Pre-processing, In-processing, Post-processing):
   * Technique: AIF360 allows defining "protected attributes" (e.g., team_id, project_type, seniority_of_reporter if available in a real dataset). It then calculates various fairness metrics (e.g., Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference) to quantify bias in the training data, in the model's predictions, or in its outcomes for different groups.
   * Application to Issue Priority: A data scientist could use AIF360 to analyze if issue priorities are being predicted significantly differently for issues originating from "underrepresented teams" compared to "dominant teams." It could highlight if "High" priority issues are disproportionately assigned to one group over another based on historical data.
2. Bias Mitigation Algorithms:
   * Technique: AIF360 offers algorithms to reduce bias at different stages:
      * Pre-processing (e.g., Reweighing, Disparate Impact Remover): Modifies the training data to be fairer. Reweighing assigns different weights to instances in the training data to balance representation across protected groups, ensuring the model learns a less biased relationship.
      * In-processing (e.g., Adversarial Debiasing): Modifies the training algorithm to make the model less biased during the learning process. It trains a predictor to perform well while simultaneously trying to prevent an adversary from predicting the protected attribute from the predictor's output.
      * Post-processing (e.g., Reject Option Classification, Calibrated Equalized Odds): Adjusts the model's predictions after training. Reject Option Classification allows for a "reject" option for samples where the model is uncertain or potentially biased, allowing for human review.
   * Application to Issue Priority:
      * To address underrepresentation bias, Reweighing could assign higher weights to issues from underrepresented teams during training, ensuring their patterns are learned more effectively.
      * To counter historical labeling bias, a post-processing algorithm could adjust the predicted priorities to ensure that "High" priority is assigned equitably across different teams, even if the model's raw prediction leaned otherwise. This would ensure that the model does not simply reproduce past human biases in prioritization.
By integrating AIF360 into the model development and deployment pipeline, the company can actively monitor for, detect, and apply strategies to mitigate biases, fostering a more equitable and efficient issue management system that serves all teams fairly.
